## Introduction
Among many coding works that have been done during this B.Eng. program, only those projects of top originality are presented here:
* Scoring System: Python
  - The core algorithm was of NLP and deep learning, and a system was further developed on its basis.
  - Data were collected from the official website by a crawler.
  - Data were preprocessed with Pandas and Jieba, a Python NLP package that processes Chinese. Feature engineering was involved.
  - Preprocessed data were embedded and vectorized by BERT-Chinese, an NLP model pretrained with Chinese.
  - A BPNN was trained with the dataset of information vectors in order to fit real score.
  - The model was embedded in a Wechat mini program.
* Discrete Event-Driven Simulator: C++
  - The simulator modeled a queue-and-serve sceanrio in order to evaluate the service system with statistics.
  - The data structure was implemented and a Mersenne Twister pseudo-random generator was realized.
  - Entities including buffer and servicer and events including arrival, queuing and serving were defined.
  - Priorities were assigned to different queues and more complicated sceanrios were programmed.
  - Visualization was implemented as an auxiliary function.
* Logo Identification: Java & CSS
  - This APP aimed at realizing login and query functions and providing logo identification service to users.
  - Logics of login and detect pages were handled and UI were developed.
  - Functions including obtaining access to local media, encoding images and performing internet connection were realized.
  - Cloud service of logo detection and identification was accessed.
